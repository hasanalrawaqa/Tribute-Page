            "Among the great leaders of the world, Sultan Suleiman stands out as a true embodiment of
             justice, piety, and wisdom. His reign was marked by many achievements, both in the realm of 
              politics and culture. He was a just ruler who always put the interests of his people above his own, 
               and he showed great compassion towards the poor and the oppressed. May Allah bless his soul
                and grant him a place in Jannah (Paradise)."<br> <span class="sayer">- Ebussuud Efendi</span></p>
